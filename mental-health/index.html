	<p>When the thought of women’s mental health comes to mind, oftentimes it is associated with a mental condition such as dementia, anxiety disorder, or clinical depression. The matter of the fact is that these two categories are very different than each other. Women’s mental health is extremely important and should never be put on the back burner.
Women’s mental health is an important element in one’s overall well-being and contentedness, as it maintains cognitive alternates, emotional sanity, and balance of ourselves, lives, and relationships. When one is mentally balanced and at peace with themselves internally, they are practicing good mental health.</p>

	<p>Sex and gender differences are important determinants of mental health and mental illness. For clarity, sex refers to biological differences between males and females. Gender refers to social roles and behaviors usually exhibited by men and women in society.

The development of mental health issues is usually a combination of genetics and the role and experience the person has in society. Different genders have very different experiences. The combination of the two can influence how mental health issues develop.

Research has also shown that there are significant differences between genders when it comes  to the development of common mental health disorders. These include eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.

By unearthing the causes of gender differences in mental health, more people can benefit from increased accuracy in diagnosing mental health conditions and more effective, tailored treatment options.
